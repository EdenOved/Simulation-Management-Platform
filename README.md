## **Problem Addressed**

Simulation systems are widely used across various research fields to study and model real-world phenomena in controlled environments. However, the **lack of comprehensive management systems** creates inefficiencies, including:
-  Long experiment cycles due to manual simulation management.
-  Difficulty in tracking real-time performance and adjusting simulations on the go.
-  Limited tools for in-depth analysis of simulation results.
